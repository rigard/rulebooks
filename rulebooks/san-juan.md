# Setup

1. The 5 **Role Tiles** are laid out face up in the centre of the table.

2. The 5 **Trade House Tiles** are shuffled and stacked face down beside the role tiles.

3. Each player places an Indigo Plant** from the card deck face up in front of them.

4. Shuffle the deck and **deal 4 cards to each player**.

5. The remaining cards are set face down in the centre of the table as the draw pile. _Discards must be placed face down._

6.  A randomly determined starting player takes the **Governor Tile**.

Cards are used as _money_ when building, as _goods_ when producing or trading, and occasionally as _Victory Point_ counters.

# Turn Overview

## 1) Choose a Role

Starting with the Governor, each player chooses a role. Each role has an **action** and a **privilege**. The player who chooses the role benefits from the privilege as well as the action, and then all other players in turn may perform the action once. After all players perform the action, the next player chooses a role.

* the choosing player always goes first.

* a role must be chosen, but a player may refrain from taking the action.

* each role may only be chosen once per round.

**In a 2-player game** , the Governor chooses a second role and plays again as above.

## 2) The Round Ends

After each player has chosen a role, and every player has had the chance to perform every action, the round ends.

* place all used roles back in the centre of the table.

* pass the Governor card to the left. The new Governor reminds _Chapel_ owners to store cards if they wish. He also checks all players’ hand count and all players discard to their hand limit (7, except for _Tower_ owners who can have 12).

* another round is begun, beginning with the new Governor.

# Game End

**The game ends at the end of a Building phase in which any player builds a 12th building**. The remaining round is not completed.

**Victory Points** are added up on the score pad, counting:

* the building points (on the bottom of the building cards).

* the number of cards under a _Chapel_.

* the Victory Points from the _Triumphal Arch, Guild Hall, City_ _Hall,_ and finally the _Palace._

**The player with the most Victory Points is the winner.** A tie is won by the player with the most cards in his hand and goods.
