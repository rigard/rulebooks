# SETUP

Place all the **buildings** on their spaces and all the **doubloons** on the **bank** on the game board.

Each player takes his player board and initial money (stored face up on his windrose).

A random player is **first player** and takes the **Governor** card.

All players take their initial **plantation tile** and place it face up on any of their 12 island spaces.

All 8 **quarry tiles** are placed face up beside the board. The remaining **plantation tiles** are shuffled and placed face down in 5 stacks. 4-6 tiles are taken from the stacks and placed face up next to the quarry tiles.

Place by the game board the **victory point chips** , the **role cards** , 3 **cargo ships** , all the **goods** in 5 piles, the **trading house** , the **colonist ship** and the **colonist markers** , all depending on the number of players:

# The Roles

## SETTLER

### Action

**Take 1 face-up plantation tile** and place it on an empty island space.

### Privilege

**May take a quarry tile (if available) instead of a face-up plantation tile.**

Finally, the settler player puts the untaken plantation tiles face-up on a discard stack and draws new tiles (one more than the number of players) from the facedown stacks. Shuffle discarded tiles to form new stacks if necessary.

Plantations may be moved on island spaces without penalty, but may not be removed.

## MAYOR

### Action

**Take 1 colonist from the colonist ship,** one at a time clockwise starting with the Mayor until none remain.

A player may place his new colonist(s), together with all the colonists he acquired from earlier rounds, on any empty circles on the tiles on his player board. Any colonists that cannot be placed are stored in San Juan. Colonists _must_ be placed on empty circles if possible.

When at least one colonist is on a tile, it is considered _occupied_ and may produce raw materials.

### Privilege

**Take 1 additional colonist from the colonist supply (if available).**

Finally the Mayor places new colonists on the ship; one for each empty circle on the _buildings_ on the player boards of all players (minimum is equal to the number of players).

## BUILDER

### Action

**Build 1 building** and place it on an empty city space (or 2 spaces for a large building). Pay the cost in doubloons to the bank.

No player may build more than 1 building per round.

Each _occupied_ quarry reduces the cost for building by 1 doubloon, subject to the limits shown on the game board (eg buildings in the first column can reduce their cost by a maximum of 1). The cost of a building cannot be reduced below 0 doubloons.

### Privilege

**Building costs 1 doubloon less to build.**

## CRAFTSMAN

### Action

**Take goods from the supply according to production ability** and place on windrose.

### Privilege

**Take 1 additional good** of those you can produce (only if you have produced goods).

## TRADER

### Action

**Sell 1 good to the trading house** for the amount of doubloons from the bank shown. Only _different_ kinds of goods may be sold. Trading ends when all players have had one turn to sell or the trading house is full.

### Privilege

**+1 doubloon from sale.**

Finally the Trader empties the trading house _if it is full_ by placing the goods back into the supply piles.

## CAPTAIN

### Action

**Load goods on the cargo ships.** Each player may load goods of one type at a time, and the phase continues as long as at least one player has goods he can load.

Each ship carries goods of only one kind, and goods may not be loaded on a ship if they are on another ship.

On a player’s turn he _must_ load goods if he can, and as many of those goods as he can. He must choose the ship where he can load the most goods.

For each barrel loaded of _any type_ , the player earns 1 VP. VP are kept secret from the other players.

### Privilege

**Earn +1 VP only when loading first goods.**

Finally, when no more goods can be loaded, each player may store one excess good on his windrose. All other remaining goods must be stored in warehouses or returned to the supply.

The Captain then unloads all full ships by placing the goods back into the supply piles.

## PROSPECTOR

### Action

There is no action. The other players do not do anything.

### Privilege

**Receive 1 doubloon from the bank.**

# BUILDINGS

Each player may build each building only once.

When at least one colonist is in the building, it is considered _occupied_.

Buildings may be moved on city spaces without penalty, but may not be removed.

## PRODUCTION BUILDINGS

Production buildings are required, together with the plantations, to produce goods.

The number of circles on the building shows the maximum number of goods the building can produce when the circles have colonists on them.

The player must also have sufficient _occupied_ plantations of the appropriate good to produce the raw materials.

**Corn does not require a production building** and comes directly from the plantation.

## VIOLET BUILDINGS, SMALL

A player is not required to use the special function of an occupied violet building, large or small, if he does not wish to.

### Small Market

Trader Phase** Receive an extra doubloon when selling a good.

### Hacienda

Settler Phase** Before taking a face-up plantation tile, take an _additional_ tile from a face-down stack.

It must be immediately placed on an empty island space. You cannot ever take a quarry instead of the extra tile.

### Construction Hut

**Settler Phase** Receive a quarry _instead_ of a face-up plantation tile. You may only ever take one quarry.

### Small Warehouse

**Captain Phase** May store on your windrose, _in addition_ to the single good normally allowed, all the goods of one kind.

### Hospice

**Settler Phase** When placing a plantation or quarry tile on your island, take _one_ colonist from the pool and place it on that tile.

If taking an additional tile for any reason, there is no colonist for the extra tile. You may take the colonist from the ship if there are none in the supply.

### Office

**Trader Phase** A good sold to the trading house need not be different than goods already there.

### Large Market

**Trader Phase** Receive 2 extra doubloons when selling a good. Cumulative with a small market.

### Large Warehouse

**Captain Phase** May store on your windrose, _in addition_ to the single good normally allowed, all the goods of two kinds. Cumulative with a small warehouse.

### Factory

**Craftsman Phase** If you produce goods of more than one _kind_, earn doubloons from the bank: 1 for 2 kinds, 2 for 3 kinds, 3 for 4 kinds and 5 for all 5 kinds.

### University

**Builder Phase** When you build a building, take _one_ colonist from the pool and place it on that tile.

You may take the colonist from the ship if there are none in the supply.

### Harbor

**Captain Phase** Each _time_ you load goods on a cargo ship, earn 1 extra Victory Point.

### Wharf

**Captain Phase** _Once_ per Captain phase, when loading goods, you may place _all goods of any one kind_ in the goods supply and score the Victory Points as though they were loaded normally.

You must load goods on a cargo ship whenever you can on your turn as normal, except when choosing to load on this ‘imaginary’ ship. The ship has an 11 barrel capacity.

## VIOLET BUILDINGS, LARGE

Large buildings require two adjacent city spaces to be built, but count as one building.

Additional VP is earned at game end if the large building is occupied.

### Guild Hall

1 VP for each small production building (occupied or unoccupied) and 2 VP for each large production building (occupied or unoccupied).

### Residence

4 VP for up to 9 filled spaces on your island, 5 VP for up to 10, 6 VP for up to 11, and 7 VP if all 12 spaces are filled.

### Fortress

1 VP for every three colonists on your player board.

### Customs House

1 VP for every 4 VP acquired during the game.

### City Hall

1 VP for each violet building (occupied or unoccupied) in your city, including the city hall.

# GAME ROUND

## 1) CHOOSE A ROLE

The player with the **Governor** card starts a round by taking a role card.

Each role has an **action** and a **privilege**.

The player who chooses the role benefits from the privilege as well as the action, and then all other players in turn may perform the action once.

After all players have performed the action, the next player to the left chooses one of the remaining role cards, and so on until all players have taken a role card and all players have taken their actions.

- if a card has doubloons on it the player who takes the card also gets the doubloons.

- a player must always take a role card, but may choose _not_ to take the action or privilege himself

- all actions are _optional_ (except the _Captain_ )

## 2) RESET THE ROLES

Place one doubloon on each of the three role cards not chosen this round and then return all role cards.

The player to the left of the Governor takes the Governor card and becomes Governor for the next round.

# GAME END

The game ends _at the end_ of the round when one of the following happens:

- at the end of the Mayor phase there are not enough colonists to fill the colonist ship.

- during the Builder phase when a player builds on his 12th city space.

- during the Captain phase when the last of the victory point chips is used.

**Victory points are scored:**

Each player adds together:

- the value of his VP chips,

- the VP value of his buildings (occupied or empty),

- the extra VPs of his _occupied_ large buildings.

The player with the most VPs is the winner.

If there is a tie the player with the most doubloons and goods (1 good = 1 doubloon) is the winner.
