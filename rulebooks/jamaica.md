# Setup

Each player takes a **ship’s hold board** , a **ship** and a matching set of **action cards** , which are shuffled and placed facedown above the holds. Ships are placed on the **Port Royale** space on the board.

Randomly select 9 of the 12 **treasure cards** , shuffle them and place them facedown on the space to the right of the navigation box. The remaining 3 cards go back in the game box unseen.

Place the **combat die** on the fortress and the 9 **treasure tokens** on the 9 pirate lair spaces on the board. Sort the resources ( **food** , **gunpower** and **doubloons** ) by type by the side of the board to form the **bank**.

Each player places **3 food tokens** and **3 doubloons** in two of his holds, and draws the first 3 cards from his action deck, keeping them secret.

Randomly select a first player. He gets the **compass** and the 2 **action dice** and is **Captain** for the first turn.

# Game Round

1. **Throw Action Dice** The Captain throws the **action** **dice** and chooses which order to place them on the navigation box.

2. **Choose Card** Each player chooses an **action card** (discards are shuffled to form a new deck if required) and puts it facedown across their discard pile.

3. **Actions** The Captain turns over his action card and carries out his **morning action** (top left), then his **evening action** (top right). In turn, the other players reveal their cards and carry out their actions.<br><br>The morning action must be _completely resolved_ before the evening action.

4. **End of Round** Each player takes the top card of their action deck and the compass moves to the next player clockwise, who is now **Captain**.

# Action Symbols

## Loading

If a **loading symbol** is shown ( **food** , **gunpower** or **doubloons** ) the player must load the number of tokens shown by the action die into an _empty_ hold.

If the player does not have an empty hold then one must be emptied (return tokens to the bank) to make room. A hold containing the same type of token as the one you are loading cannot be emptied. If all holds are filled with that type, the action is ignored.

## Movement

If a **movement symbol** is shown the player _must_ move his ship forwards (green) or backwards (red) the number of spaces shown by the action die.

A player may move backwards on his first movement, but an entire circuit of the island must be completed to win the game.

If the final space of the move is occupied, **combat** must immediately take place. After any combat, the **cost** of the space must be paid.

# Combat

The player landing in an occupied space is the attacker. If there is more than one opposing ship, the attacker chooses who to fight, and there is only one battle. No combat can take place in Port Royale.

The attacker spends the number of gunpowder tokens of his choice and adds that number to the result of a combat die roll. This is his combat strength. The defender then does the same.

The player with the higher strength wins. If there is a tie, nothing happens.

If a player rolls the star, he immediately wins the battle (his gunpowder is still used). If the attacker, the defender cannot defend himself. If the defender, he wins regardless of the combat strength of the attacker.

The winner may choose one of the following options:

1. Steal the contents of one of the loser’s holds (usual loading rules apply).

2. Steal a **treasure** from the loser (you cannot first look at a player’s facedown treasures).

3. Give a **cursed treasure** to the loser.

# Cost of Spaces

A **port space** costs the number of doubloons shown on the golden needle (paid to the bank).

A **sea space** costs the number of food tokens shown by the white squares (paid to the bank).

A **pirate lair space** costs nothing; if the treasure token is still there, it is removed from the game and the player takes a treasure card, putting it next to his holds.

If a player cannot pay a space’s cost there is a **shortage**. The player pays to the bank as much as he can afford, then moves his ship back to the first space where he is able to pay the _full_ cost (even a pirate lair, where there is nothing to pay and he may take the treasure, if there). He may choose the route if there is a fork.

He must then pay the cost of the new space. If the space is already occupied there is a battle first.

# Treasures

**Treasures** modify a player’s score at the end of the game (**cursed** treasures negatively). They are placed facedown by a player’s holds and only revealed at the end of the game. A player can have more than one treasure card, and any treasure can be stolen or given during combat.

# Powers

Four of the treasure cards are **special powers**.

They are placed _faceup_ by a player’s holds. The player may use the power as long as he has the card.

**Morgan’s Map**

The player can have 4 action cards in his hand.

**Saran’s Sabre**

Allows the player to re-roll his own combat die or make his opponent re-roll his (even the **star**). The second result must be accepted.

**Lady Beth**

+2 to the combat die.

**6th Hold**

Acts as a sixth hold (usual loading rules apply).

# End of the Game

As soon as a player reaches **Port Royale** , he stops. Any remaining evening action he has is ignored.

The current game round is finished normally, the game ends and players add up their points.

**Final Score** = the white number on the space where the player’s ship is plus any doubloons in his holds plus any treasures minus any cursed treasures.

Ending on the -5 space or before it costs 5 points.

**The winner is the player with the highest number of points.** On a tie, the player furthest along in the race wins. Otherwise tied players share the victory.

# Two Player Game

The black ship starts at Port Royale as the **Ghost Ship**.
It starts with a ship’s hold board with 5 doubloons in one hold and 3 in another and the **Lady Beth** card. This card can never be stolen.

After the two players move, the Ghost Ship moves twice as determined by the action dice. It never pays any costs.

If it is leading the race it must move backwards; if last, it must move forwards; if otherwise, the Captain chooses (he may even make it attack his own ship). The Captain also chooses the direction the Ghost Ship moves if there is a fork.

The Ghost Ship takes treasure from pirate lair spaces if it is there. The treasure is left facedown (the players may not see it) and placed next to its holds.

Battles are fought normally, with the opposing player rolling the combat die for the Ghost Ship and taking any decisions required if it wins.

If it wins, it can steal whatever it wants, however anything other than doubloons is thrown into the sea (returned to the bank). Doubloons are placed in its holds according to the normal loading rules. It can also steal treasure cards, but never gives any away.

A player who wins fighting a Ghost Ship may steal the contents of a hold, steal a treasure card (except the **Lady Beth**) or give it a treasure card.
