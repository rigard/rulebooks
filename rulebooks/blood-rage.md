# SETUP

Each player chooses a **clan** and places the clan sheet in front of them. Take your clan’s **leader figure** and 8 **warrior figures** , and attach the plastic bases of your clan’s color to them. Take your matching **ship figure**. Keep your figures near your clan sheet in an area called your **reserve**.

Take your clan’s extra 2 small bases and 2 large bases. Place all **monster** figures next to the board.

Place your clan’s **glory marker** on the 0 space of the **Glory track** on the board.

Place 1 of your **clan tokens** on the first spot of each of the 3 **clan stats** on your clan sheet: **Rage** , **Axes** , and **Horns**. All players start with the following stats: 6 Rage, 3 Axes, and 4 Horns. Place your last clan token on the 6 spot of the the **Rage track** (since your starting Rage stat is 6).

Place the **Valhalla sheet** and the **Age track sheet** next to the board.

Place the **pillage token** with the green border on the _Yggdrasil_ province at the center of the board, with the reward side faceup. Shuffle the other 8 pillage tokens and place them randomly, faceup, one on each of the other 8 provinces surrounding _Yggdrasil_.

Shuffle the 8 **Ragnarök tokens** and place 1 on each of the 3 Ragnarök spots on the Age track, text side faceup.

Place the **Doom token** on the province written on the Ragnarök token on the First Age track.

Depending on the number of players, randomly take the number of Ragnarök tokens noted below and place them, **destroyed** side faceup, on the provinces written on them.

* 5 player game: no provinces destroyed.

* 4 player game: 1 province destroyed.

* 3 player game: 2 provinces destroyed.

* 2 player game: 3 provinces destroyed.

Return the remaining Ragnarök tokens to the box.

A province with a Ragnarök token on it is out of the game; no figures can ever be placed in that province.

Separate the cards by their card backs, creating 3 decks: 1, 2, and 3. Depending on the number of players, remove these cards:

* 5 player game: add the 5+ cards.

* 4 player game: do not remove any cards.

* 3 player game: remove all 4+ cards.

* 2 player game: remove all 3+ and 4+ cards.

Place the **Saga token** on the first spot of the First Age on the **Story track** (_Gods’ Gifts – Age 1_).

Give the **first player token** to the player who was born furthest to the north. That player starts the game during the First Age. The first player token is passed to the player to the left at the end of each age.

The **board** is divided into 9 **provinces**. The center province is _Yggdrasil_ , and there are 8 outer provinces around it, divided into 3 **regions** : _Manheim_ , _Alfheim_ , and _Jotunheim_. Provinces that share a border are adjacent.

Each of the provinces has 3 to 5 **villages**. Each village can hold a single plastic figure. There is no limit to the number of figures that can occupy _Yggdrasil_.

There are 4 **fjords** between pairs of outer provinces. Each _supports_ the 2 provinces that it is connected to. Any effect that affects a province also affects its supporting fjord. There is no limit to the number of ship figures that can occupy each fjord.

# GAME TURN

The game is played over a series of 3 **Ages** , each of which is divided into 6 **phases** , played in order.

Move the Saga token on the Age track as each phase is completed.

Once the last phase of an Age is done, the Saga token is moved to the first phase of the next Age, until it reaches the end of the Third Age and the game ends.

## 1. GOD’S GIFTS

On the Second and Third Age, if a player has a leftover card in their hand from a previous age, they must first place this card face down on their clan sheet, on top of their clan symbol.

Take the deck of cards from the Age track matching the current Age and deal 8 cards to each player. There will always be 2 cards left over (4 in a 2 player game): discard these without looking at them.

Each player inspects the cards they were dealt and selects 1 to keep, placing it facedown on their clan sheet, on top of the symbol of their clan animal. Once everyone has done this, everyone passes the rest of their cards to the player on their left.

Now each player selects 1 of the cards they’ve been passed, and places it facedown on their clan sheet. Then everyone passes their remaining cards to the left.

Continue picking and passing cards until each player has placed 6 new cards on their clan sheet. Everyone will have 2 cards left: discard these without showing them.

All players should now have 6 cards in their hand, plus any card they might have saved from a previous Age. Keep these cards secret from the other players.

**2 player game:** Players select 2 cards to keep (instead of 1) and pass the rest to their opponent. This is done 2 more times until each player has placed 6 cards on their clan sheet. The remaining 2 cards are discarded.

## 2. ACTION

The player with the first player token goes first, with play proceeding in clockwise order. **On your turn, you must choose a single action to perform.**

If that action has a cost in **Rage**, you must pay that cost by moving the token on your Rage track, and then take your action.

You may take the same action several times throughout an Action phase, always taking a single action per turn.

If you do not have enough Rage to pay for an action, you cannot take that action.

If you are down to 0 Rage you cannot perform any action on your turn, not even an action that costs 0 Rage. All you can do is react to other player’s actions.

If you cannot take an action, or do not wish to, you can pass. However you lose all your remaining Rage and can take no further actions.

**The Action phase immediately ends when either all players are down to 0 Rage, or all of the provinces not yet destroyed have been successfully pillaged** (even if players still have Rage left).

### Invade

Choose a single figure in your reserve and pay Rage equal to that figure’s **STR**. Take that figure from your reserve and place it into any empty village in any outer province.

A ship must be placed in any fjord.

You cannot use this action to place a figure directly in _Yggdrasil_; to put your troops in _Yggdrasil_ you’ll have to **march** them there. Note that invading with your leader does not cost any Rage.

If the number of your figures on the board (_Valhalla_ is not part of the board) is equal to your current Horns stat, you cannot invade with any more figures.

### March

Pay 1 Rage and choose 1 province (not a fjord) and move any number of your figures from that province to empty villages in another single province.

The destination province doesn’t have to be adjacent; it can be anywhere on the board.

You cannot move figures from 2 different provinces in the same action, nor move your figures to 2 different provinces. You can only march from any one province to any other.

Using this action is generally the only way to get your figures to _Yggdrasil_.

There are no villages in _Yggdrasil_ , so there is no limit to the number of figures you can have there.

### Upgrade

Your clan sheet has slots for up to 8 upgrades: one each for your **warriors**, **leader** and **ship**, 2 for **monsters**, and 3 for your **clan**.

Choose an Upgrade card from your hand and pay Rage equal to that card’s **STR**. Place the card in the appropriate slot on your clan sheet.

If there is more than 1 potential slot, choose which to use.

If there is already a card in that slot, discard the old card and replace it with the new one.

The new Upgrade card is now in permanent effect, granting you any benefits listed on it. Leaders and ships always retain the abilities shown on the clan sheet, even if they are upgraded.

If your clan has 2 upgrades in different slots that give you the same type of benefit, both cards take effect independently. One does not cancel the other.

**Troop Upgrades:** When you play a leader, warrior, or ship upgrade, if you have the corresponding figure in your reserve, you may immediately (before the next player’s turn) invade with it without spending any extra Rage.

**Monster Upgrades:** When you play a monster upgrade, take the corresponding figure, attach your clan’s base to it and place it in your reserve. It is now yours for the rest of the game, counting as one of your figures. You may immediately invade with it without spending any extra Rage.

Your monster can die and be sent to Valhalla like any other figure, returning to your reserve in the next Release Valhalla phase. It can gain glory for you during the Ragnarök phase just like any other figure.

You can only have 2 Monsters as part of your clan at a time. If you discard a monster’s card in order to place a new monster in its upgrade slot, the old monster figure is immediately returned to the box.

### Quest

Take a Quest card from your hand and commit to it by placing it facedown on your clan sheet, on top of your clan’s animal symbol.

It costs no Rage to commit to a quest and there is no limit to the number of them you can commit to during each age (remember you can’t take any action if you’re down to 0 Rage).

You may commit to 2 quests of the same type (each giving its reward independently). You may inspect your quests at any time.

During this phase, try to fulfill the demands of the quests you commit to, reaping the rewards listed on them during the next Quest phase. However, there’s no penalty for failing a quest.

### Pillage

Choose a province that has at least 1 of your figures in it (or in a supporting fjord) and has not yet been successfully pillaged this phase (its **Pillage token** is showing the reward side up).

It costs no Rage to pillage (remember you can’t take any action if you’re down to 0 Rage).

A Pillaging action is resolved by following 3 steps in order:

#### 1. Call to Battle

Once you have declared your intent to pillage a province, starting with the player to your left and going clockwise, each player (including you) may, if they wish, move 1 of their figures from an adjacent province into an empty village in the province you are pillaging. This does not cost Rage (ships cannot be moved).

Any number of figures can join a battle in _Yggdrasil_.

Once all villages in the province are occupied, or when no one else wishes to join in, the battle begins.

If there are no enemy figures in the province or its supporting fjord, no battle takes place and you automatically pillage the province, gaining its **reward** and flipping its Pillage token to its _pillaged_ side. In this case you don’t gain any Glory for winning battles.

Otherwise, a battle takes place, and all figures in the province being pillaged, or its supporting fjord, must participate in it.

#### 2. Play Cards

Each player participating in the battle must choose 1 card from their hand and hold it facedown in front of them (unless they have no cards left in their hand; in that case they don’t have to put a card in).

Then all reveal their chosen card simultaneously.

**If you reveal a red Battle card**, its +STR bonus is added to the total STR of your figures in the battle, and any special abilities listed on the card take effect.

**If you reveal a black Upgrade or green Quest card**, it adds nothing to your STR in battle and has no effect.

Each clan adds together the STR of each of its involved figures, and adds the +STR bonus offered by their played Battle card (if any). This is their clan’s total STR in that battle.

If a card’s special effect causes a player to lose all the figures he had in the battle before comparing STR, his clan is not out of the battle. The figures were destroyed in the course of battle, and the clan might still win if its played Battle card has STR enough.

#### 3. Resolution

**The player with the highest STR total wins the battle.** On a tie, all participating players lose the battle.

The winner of the battle (if any) must discard all cards he played. The losers of the battle return all of their played cards to their hands.

All losing players must destroy all of their figures that were in the battle (including those that were supporting from fjords), placing them on the Valhalla sheet.

If the player who initiated the pillage wins the battle, they pillage the province and gain the reward indicated in the Pillage token (see the reference sheet). Flip the token to its _pillaged_ side to indicate that the province cannot be pillaged again until the next age.

If the pillager does not win the battle, the province is not pillaged and nobody gets the pillage reward. Any player (including the pillager) can try again later in the phase to pillage the province.

Finally, **the winner of the battle** , whether he’s the pillaging player or not, **gains Glory equal to their current Axes stat**.

## 3. DISCARD

All players must **discard** any cards that may still remain in their hands. They can only keep a single card to use on the next age (if they have any).

On the Third Age players should discard all cards, completely emptying their hands.

## 4. QUEST

Each player reveals all **quests** they have committed to. If you have met a quest’s demands, you gain the amount of Glory indicated on the card, and may also raise any 1 of your clan stats 1 step.

If you fail to fulfill a quest, you get nothing, but you also lose nothing. Discard all revealed quests, whether successful or not.

Most quests involve having the most STR in a given province. Add together the STR of each of your figures in that province (including the supporting fjord) and compare your total to the total STR of each other clan in that same province.

If your total is greater, you fulfill the quest. If you tie with an enemy, you fail the quest.

## 5. RAGNARÖK

Take the token that’s on the current **Ragnarök** slot and place it on its corresponding province, with the _destroyed_ side facing up. That province is destroyed forever and is out of the game.

When a province is destroyed this way, all figures in that province, and in its supporting fjord, die and are placed in Valhalla. Each such figure earns its clan Glory equal to that indicated on each Ragnarök slot on the Age track.

For each of your figures (including monsters) destroyed in Ragnarök, you gain 2 Glory on the First Age, 3 Glory on the Second Age, and 4 Glory on the Third Age.

Next, place the Doom token on the province indicated by the next age’s Ragnarök token.

## 6. RELEASE VALHALLA

All figures in **Valhalla** are returned to their respective owners. Move all figures on the Valhalla sheet belonging to your clan back to your reserve. Any figures on the board remain there.

## END OF AN AGE

Flip all Pillage tokens on the board back to their reward side. These tokens stay on the same province throughout the game.

Pass the first player token to the player to the left.

Move the Saga token down to the first phase of the next age on the Age track.

# END OF THE GAME

Once the Release Valhalla phase of the Third Age is completed, the world has come to an end, and so has the game.

**For each of your clan stats that has been increased to the 4th or 5th step, gain +10 Glory.**

**For each of your clan stats that has been increased to the last step, gain +20 Glory.**

The player whose clan has the most Glory is the winner.
